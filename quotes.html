            <strong>Yang Wen-li</strong>: “I believe that being ruled by the worst democracy is preferable to being ruled by the best autocracy.”
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Reinhard von Lohengramm</strong>: “I don't believe that absolute truth is necessary. I only need the power to freely accomplish my dreams. 
            One could say that it's the power not to have to take orders from those one despises.”
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>João Rebelo</strong>: “A nation’s survival isn’t something to be discussed at the level of one individual’s rights.”
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Paul von Oberstein</strong>: "All heroes have established thrones atop not just their enemies but a large quantity of allied corpses as well. 
            There are no monarchs with clean hands. Their subordinates also know that. I would like you to consider that at times, to grant 
            death is also a way to repay loyalty."
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Oskar von Reuenthal</strong>: "Regardless of the color of eyes or skin, the color of blood is the same for everyone, isn't it?"
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Yang Wen-li</strong>: “The right to violate the rights of the people belongs to the people.”
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Willibald Joachim von Merkatz</strong>: "Privilege corrupts a man's soul. You instinctively justify yourself while blaming others."
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Alexandre Bewcock</strong>: "The Alliance should die as a democracy rather than become a dictatorship to survive."
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Reinhard von Lohengramm</strong>: “For those who have come to power, wealth and glory not by their own strength and effort, but simply 
            through inheritance, what right do they have to complain? The very existence of such blood-lineage dynasties is disgusting. 
            Power is the property of one generation. It shouldn't be transferred, it should be seized.”
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Yang Wen-li</strong>: “Neither terrorism nor occultism have ever impacted history in any constructive way.”
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Walter von Schönkopf</strong>: "So governments can sell out their own people, but the reverse is not allowed?"
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Yang Wen-li</strong>: “People may need societies, but they do not necessarily need 'nations'.”
