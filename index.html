            <h2>What is Legend of the Galactic Heroes Hub?</h2>
            <p>
                This site is a place for fans of Legend of the Galactic Heroes to hear a unique perspective on some of the show’s
                themes and characters. In other words – my personal analyses of the show. I try to be as objective as possible 
                when assessing the show, but do keep in mind that everything written on this site is ultimately just my opinion. 
                I hope that my perspectives can elicit discussion about the show, and perhaps challenge some fans’ notions about 
                the show.

                Do keep in mind that this site will contain considerable story spoilers, so avert your eyes unless you’ve completed 
                the series, or simply don’t mind having the story spoiled.

            <h2>Wait, I’m Lost – What Is Legend of the Galactic Heroes?</h2>
            <p>
            I’m glad you asked! Legend of the Galactic Heroes (LoGH) is a sci-fi series created by Japanese writer Yoshiki Tanaka. 
            The original LoGH novels were written by Tanaka over the course of 1982-1987, though what catapulted the series to international 
            recognition was the 110-episode original video animation (OVA) that ran from 1988-1997. Despite its elusiveness and relative 
            obscurity, the OVA retains a cult following and is often considered one of the greatest anime series of all time.
            </p>
            <p>
            The series takes place in the far future of the Milky Way galaxy, where Earth has long since been forgotten, and two major 
            factions are embroiled in a seemingly endless war: the democratic Free Planets Alliance and autocratic Galactic Empire. 
            The story follows the two eponymous galactic heroes – Yang Wen-li of the Alliance, and Reinhard von Lohengramm of the Empire
            – as they vie for victory over one another by leveraging their military and political genius. The series explores a variety
            of mature themes pertinent to the modern socio-political landscape, considering everything from governmental corruption to 
            the human toll of war.
            </p>
            <p>
            Despite my undying love for the show, I will concede that it is not for everyone. It is undoubtedly a slow burn, and those 
            expecting nonstop action might be disappointed to find it is largely a character drama. That said, if lengthy historical-political 
            dramas are something that remotely appeals to you, I implore you to give this masterpiece a chance.

            <h2>Where Can I Watch It?</h2>
            <p>
            If you have the option to, I highly recommend watching the ’88-’97 OVA. It is generally considered the way to experience the series, 
            as it is the only complete animated adaptation. Unfortunately, however - as of September 2024, the OVA is unfortunately no longer 
            available on HIDIVE, making it impossible to find online legally. While Blu-Ray box sets can occasionally be found floating around 
            sites like Amazon and eBay, they are usually being sold for exorbitant prices.
            </p>
            <p>
            As I cannot recommend readers pirate the OVA, the next best choice for law-abiding citizens would be to watch the show’s ongoing 
            remake, Die Neue These, on Crunchyroll. Its art style and soundtrack are quite different from the OVA, though the general consensus 
            seems to be that it is a faithful remake of the original story. However, heed the fact that it is ongoing, and thus, far from finished.
            </p>
            <p>
            English translations of the original novels by Yoshiki Tanaka are also available for purchase online, and though I can’t personally 
            attest to how good the translations are, the novels themselves are generally considered to be excellent.
